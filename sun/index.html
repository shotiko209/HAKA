                <h1>The Sun (symbol: ☉) is the only star at the center of the Solar System. It is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma with magnetic fields woven into it.[12][13] The diameter of the Sun is approximately 1,392,684 kilometers [5] — 109 times the diameter of the Earth. Its mass (1.989×1030 kilograms; about 330,000 times the mass of Earth) comprises 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[14] Chemically, 3/4 of the Sun's mass is hydrogen, and the rest is mostly helium. The remaining 1.69% (which is 5,600 times the mass of Earth) consists of heavy elements such as oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, and others.[15]

                    The Sun formed 4.568 billion years ago[16][17] by the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. Most of the matter collected at the center, and the rest flattened into a rotating disk that later became the solar system. The central mass grew hotter and denser, eventually beginning thermonuclear fusion at its core. Almost all stars are thought to have formed as a result of this process. The Sun is a G-type main sequence star (G2V) in spectral class and is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf because its visible radiation is most intense in the yellow-green part of the spectrum. Although it is actually white in color, it appears yellow from the Earth's surface due to the scattering of blue light by the atmosphere.[18] According to the spectral class, G2 indicates the surface temperature (about 5505°C) and V indicates that the Sun, like other stars, is a main sequence star and therefore produces energy by fusing hydrogen into helium. The Sun synthesizes 620 million tons of hydrogen in its core per second.[19][20]</h1>
