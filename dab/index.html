        <h1>A solar eclipse is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the Moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, due to which the Sun is completely or partially covered by an observer on Earth. This can only happen at a new moon when the sun and moon are touching as seen from Earth. At least two and at most five solar eclipses can occur each year on Earth, of which none or at most two can be total eclipses. However, a total eclipse is a rare event anywhere, since totality exists only along a very narrow corridor in a relatively small portion of the lunar umbra at each eclipse.
            A total solar eclipse is an amazing natural phenomenon, and many people travel long distances specifically to witness the event. A total solar eclipse in Europe in 1999 made it possible to raise public awareness of this phenomenon. The last total solar eclipse occurred on July 22, 2009.</h1>
