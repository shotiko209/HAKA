            <h2>The Moon does not move in a circle around the Earth, it moves in an elliptical (eccentricity 0.0549) orbit (semi-major axis 384 748 km) at a speed of 1.02 km/s. An elliptical orbit causes a noticeable change in the distance between the Moon and Earth, which in turn changes the size of the Moon's halo as seen from Earth. For example, the Moon's halo seen from Earth is 14% larger at perigee (≈ 363 104 km) than at apogee (≈ 405 696 km). The Moon moves away from the Earth by about 3.8 centimeters per year[1][2].</h2>
            <h1>The Moon (Symbol: ☾ or ☽) is Earth's only natural satellite and the closest celestial body to us. One of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and among the largest satellites in size relative to the planet they orbit. Also, among the densities of known satellites today, it has the second highest density (after Jupiter's moon Io). It does not have any formal name other than the moon, although it is generally referred to as "Luna" (adj. lunar) in scientific works (lat. Luna). Its symbol is the crescent moon. The average distance of the Moon from the Earth is 384,000 km. The perigee distance is 363,104 km and the apogee distance is 405,696 km. Its diameter is 3,476 km.</h1>
